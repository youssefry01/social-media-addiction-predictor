## 🧠 Overview

This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to predict a numerical **Addiction Score** from factors like age, gender, platform usage, sleep patterns, and relationship status. The goal is to gain insight into how different habits and demographics influence potential social media addiction.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Social Media Addiction vs Relationships](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships)
- **Size**: ~300 entries
- **Features**:
  - Age, Gender, Relationship Status
  - Average daily social media usage
  - Sleep hours per night
  - Most used social media platform
  - Self-reported addiction score

---

## 🔍 Features & Flow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Dropped duplicates and irrelevant columns
   - Standardized column names
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Grouped age, sleep hours, and usage into categories
   - Consolidated less common platforms under "Other"

3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained a Linear Regression model
   - Evaluated using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
   - Visualized feature importance

4. **Deployment**:
   - Built an interactive UI using Streamlit
   - Accepts input fields and provides a score + qualitative feedback
